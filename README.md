To import in a virutal environment in Windows
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## For Windows, the Intel Distribution for Python is used
https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python/choose-download/windows.html

This was chosen because modules like scikit-learn could not be installed for latest Python 3.9
This Intel distribution comes with all necessary packages for machine learning and data analysis
    Note: The Intel distribution does not support powershell, so the usual command prompt is used
